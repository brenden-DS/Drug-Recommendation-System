# Drug Recommendation System

This repository contains the code for a drug recommendation system based on a dataset with the following features: age, sex, blood pressure (bp), cholesterol, and sodium-potassium ratio (na to k).

## Overview

The drug recommendation system is designed to analyze patient data and recommend the most suitable drug based on the input features. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to process the dataset and make personalized drug recommendations for patients.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes the following features:

- Age: The age of the patient
- Sex: The gender of the patient
- Blood Pressure (BP): The blood pressure of the patient
- Cholesterol: The cholesterol level of the patient
- Sodium-Potassium Ratio (Na to K): The ratio of sodium to potassium in the patient's body

## Usage

To use the drug recommendation system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies as specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the main script to input patient data and receive a drug recommendation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the drug recommendation system, refer to the documentation in the directory for detailed instructions on setup and usage.
